// src/groupings.ts
//
// The area axis and the area <-> grouping maps.
//
// NOTHING about a utility's areas ships in the build. The axis is read from
// the first hour of the first CSV loaded (pool.ts readAreaAxis) or from a
// saved bundle, and group membership is loaded from a Groupings.csv or a
// .gvap. Before either happens this module knows no areas and no groups,
// which is the correct empty state for an app that gets handed around.
//
// Two separate things live in this file, and conflating them is the bug this
// layout exists to prevent:
//
//   THE AREA AXIS is the area names in cube-index order, read from the data.
//   Its length must equal the parser's compiled NUM_AREAS (pool.ts checks
//   this), so an export with a different area count needs a parser rebuild --
//   but the names themselves are the file's, never this app's.
//
//   GROUP MEMBERSHIP is many-to-many and editable at runtime. One area can
//   belong to any number of groups, and a group may name an area that is not
//   on the axis at all: a mapping written for a bigger study still loads, and
//   the editor shows those names as missing rather than dropping them
//   silently.
